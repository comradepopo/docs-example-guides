# Bringing it Together 

We've come a long way from our "Hello World" application! With a little imagination and some tweaking, our app could be 
a pretty useful thing. Let's flush this out to be a more useful company directory.

We've made the following adjustments to our previous example:

* Tweaked the second tab so that it contains company "about" information.

* Added grouping to our store, so that the grid is grouped by location

* Added more data to populate our grid

* Hooked up an AJAX proxy instead of hard-coding the data in the store

* Added more form fields to our form panel, including data binding

* Adjusted our form panel's Submit button to commit any form panel changes to the record

The possibilities are really endless. You can make anything, and as you can see, you can do so with very little code.

**Hint:** There is A LOT to know about Ext JS but you don't have to know everything to get started. Just start 
simple, [ask for help](https://www.sencha.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?133-Ext-6-Q-amp-A), and read the docs! You'll be 
making your own applications in no time.

## What's Next

In the next section, we'll use Sencha Cmd to further organize our application and make it as lightweight as possible.
