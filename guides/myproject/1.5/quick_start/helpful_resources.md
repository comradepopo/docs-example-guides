# Helpful Resources

Before cutting you loose, you may want to review these helpful resources to ensure that your learning path with Ext JS 
has a solid foundation!

## Fiddle

You can test out the framework via our [Fiddle tool](http://fiddle.sencha.com/). Fiddle allows you to manipulate a 
bare-bones starter application and immediately see your changes in the preview pane. For inspiration, you can check out 
our Examples as a place to start with your Fiddle.

## Examples

Our [examples](http://examples.sencha.com/extjs/6.5.0/examples/) contain a collection of powerful, but simple, starting 
points for applications. From our Application Templates to the Kitchen Sink, you can find examples involving almost 
any class in the Ext JS framework.

## Kitchen Sink

The [Kitchen Sink](http://examples.sencha.com/extjs/6.5.0/examples/kitchensink/) is a specific application that helps 
demonstrate many components and concepts from Ext JS. This application displays many components, with all of our 
themes, locale examples, and even RTL (right-to-left) integration. The Kitchen Sink is a great place to go for ideas on 
getting started with an application, or a look at how to get from point A to B.

## Documentation

[Documentation](http://docs.sencha.com/) will be a regular part of your Ext JS workflow regardless of your knowledge of 
the framework. It's a resource that documents every class we offer, in addition to said class's configs, events, 
properties, etc. Our documentation is now available for nearly any modern browser on nearly any device.
