# Introduction

Welcome to the Ext JS Quick Start guide! In this guide, we'll quickly walk through the most important core concepts 
you'll need to understand to be an effective Ext JS developer. In each step, we'll look at a working code example 
and then discuss any new concepts.  We will adapt each section into an eventual Company Directory application that 
you can download or use in our Fiddle tool.

To get started, let's look at a simple "Hello World" application using the Ext JS Modern Toolkit.

## Hello world!

    @example:extjs-6.5.0-material-modern
    Ext.Viewport.add({
        xtype: 'panel',
        html: 'Hello World!'
    });

**Hint:** Click "Run" to see the code render as an application. (It will run at launch here) 

As you can see from this inline code example, generating an Ext JS "Hello World" application is a pretty simple task.

After following through this Quick Guide, our Hello World application will look like this:

**Hint:**  In a real world application, you would not include all of your code in a single file.  While it will work,
 we're only doing this for ease of presentation.  If you would like to download the appropriately structured example, 
 please grab the application from this [GitHub link](https://github.com/sencha-extjs-examples/QuickStart/archive/master.zip).

## What's Next

We'll talk about what all of this means in the following sections, but we wanted to give you the good stuff at the 
very beginning. Feel free to play around with the code samples, or move on to Components!
