# Theming Ext JS (Classic Toolkit)
The default themes available with Ext JS can be used out of the box to create clean, 
professional looking applications.  However, you may wish to provide your own styling that 
matches your personal design aesthetic or that of an existing enterprise design.  

Historically, styling an application meant creating style sheets with rules meant to 
decorate individual HTML elements used in the rendering of a component.  Several issues 
arise with this approach.  The first being that you’re now burdened with styling across 
all supported browsers.  Secondly, as the framework matures the underlying component 
elements may change leaving you with the unpleasant task of chasing the changes in your 
style rules as they relate to the evolved element structure.  Styling your application 
using the theming API offered with ExtJS solves these problems for you.

Themes created using the theming API may be shared across any Ext JS application in the 
workspace folder.  This allows you to style once and apply that style over and over with 
confidence in the consistency of your applications’ look and feel.  This guide will list 
the requirements necessary for theming as well as walk you through the steps of generating 
a sample workspace, application, and custom theme along with application-specific styling.

This guide will cover the basics of theming starting with how to create a custom theme 
using the classic toolkit (legacy Ext JS).  Next, we’ll cover the differences when creating 
a theme targeting the modern toolkit (legacy Sencha Touch) as well as a Universal app 
(containing both classic and modern views).  Finally, we’ll introduce the Triton theme and 
showcase the flexibility it adds to the themes roster.

## Requirements

### Sencha Cmd 6+
Sencha Cmd is a command-line tool used to package and deploy Ext JS applications.  To build 
a theme in Ext JS, you must have Sencha Cmd 6 or higher installed on your computer.
For more information about installing and getting started with Sencha Cmd see 
[Introduction to Sencha Cmd](../../../../cmd/guides/intro_to_cmd.html).

### Java JRE 1.7+ (optional, but recommended)
[Java JRE 1.7+](http://java.com/en/download/) is required to run “sencha app watch”.  This 
command is run within the application directory and updates the compiled theme automatically 
as you modify the theme source.  Cmd 6+ has two installers available: with the JRE packaged 
into the installer or as a stand-alone installer without the JRE.
**Note:** Without Java JRE 1.7+ and “sencha app watch” you will need to run 
“sencha app refresh” after each change made to the application and / or theme as you follow 
through the steps in this guide.

### Ext JS
Custom themes are based on default themes included with the Ext JS SDK.
[Download Ext JS](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/evaluate/) and extract the Ext JS 
development kit (SDK) to a location of your choosing.

## Building a Custom Theme
Once you have installed all of the above requirements for theme building, you can proceed 
with creating a fully customized theme.

## Set up the Workspace (optional)
Workspaces generated by Sencha Cmd are instrumental in allowing the Ext SDK and packages, 
including themes, to be shared across applications located in the workspace.  However, 
setting up a workspace is not a requirement for theming.  If you are creating a theme 
within a stand-alone application you may skip to the next section.

**Note:** If you are not using a workspace, please make sure to remove “workspace” from our 
example file paths as necessary.

For this tutorial we’ll create a workspace using Sencha Cmd so that the custom theme is 
accessible to all apps within the workspace.  Run the following command from the web server 
directory where your workspace will be created (replace {path/to/Ext-JS-SDK} in the following 
command with the local path to the Ext JS SDK).

	sencha -sdk {path/to/Ext-JS-SDK} generate workspace my-workspace

The `generate workspace` command will create the scaffolding for a Sencha workspace in the 
target directory "my-workspace".  The `generate workspace` command copies the Ext JS SDK 
workspace so that the theme and application can find their required dependencies. This 
workspace is where your custom theme package will live.  You will also create an application 
here that will use your custom theme.  Next, change your working directory to the new 
"my-workspace" directory:

	cd my-workspace

You should now see two directories inside your workspace folder:

**"ext"** – contains the Ext JS SDK  
**"packages"** – will contain the packages/themes used by applications in the workspace

##Generating an Application for Testing the Theme
Before creating a custom theme we need to set up a way to test the theme. Generate a skeleton 
Ext JS application using the classic toolkit.  Run the following command from the 
"my-workspace" directory:

	sencha -sdk ext generate app -classic ThemeDemoApp theme-demo-app

Sencha Cmd has now generated an application named ThemeDemoApp in a new sub-directory named 
"theme-demo-app".  Change the working directory to the newly created application directory:

	cd theme-demo-app

##Generating the Custom Theme Package and File Structure
Sencha Cmd simplifies the process of creating a custom theme by generating a theme package 
containing all the necessary files required for your custom theme.  Run the following 
command from the “theme-demo-app” directory:

	sencha generate theme my-classic-theme

This tells Sencha Cmd to generate a theme package named "my-classic-theme" in the “packages” 
directory. You should see a newly created directory named "my-classic-theme" in the 
“packages/local/” directory.  Let’s take a look at the default contents of the custom theme 
folder:

**"package.json"** - This is the package properties file. It tells Sencha Cmd certain 
things about the package like its name, version, and dependencies (other packages that it 
requires).

**"sass/"** - This directory contains all of your theme’s Fashion source files. The source 
files are divided into 4 main sections:
"sass/var/" - contains variables  
"sass/src/" - contains rules and UI mixin calls that can use the variables defined in 
“sass/var/”  
"sass/etc/" - contains additional utility functions or mixins  
“sass/example” - contains files used when generating sample components used in image 
slicing (despite its name, this folder is used by Sencha Cmd and should not be deleted)

**"resources/"** - contains images and other static resources that your theme requires

**"overrides/"** - contains any JavaScript overrides to Ext JS component classes that are 
required for theming those components

**Note:** The files and folders in "sass/var/", "sass/src", and “overrides” should be 
structured to match the file path of the component you are styling / overriding.  For 
example, variables that change the appearance of [[ext:Ext.panel.Panel]] will be placed 
in a file named "sass/var/panel/Panel.scss".

Going forward, we’ll be making incremental changes to the theme and sample application.  We’ll 
want Sencha Cmd to detect these changes and compiled them into the output CSS used by the 
application.  To accomplish this, run the following command:

	sencha app watch

Reminder: The “sencha app watch” command requires Java JRE 1.7+.  If you are unable to run 
“sencha app watch” you’ll need to run “sencha app refresh” after each change to the theme.  For 
brevity, we’ll assume you have “sencha app watch” running for the duration of this guide.

Sencha Cmd 6+ makes updating the style for a generated app easier than ever when using 
“sencha app watch”.  After running “sencha app watch” you can pull up your application using 
the url: “localhost:1841/theme-demo-app/” and add **“?platformTags=fashion:true”** to the 
end of the url:

	http://localhost:1841/theme-demo-app/?platformTags=fashion:true

Appending “?platformTags=fashion:true” will instruct the browser to refresh the styling 
within the application as you make changes to the application’s theme - often in under 
a second.

**Note:** Rapid updates using “?platformTags=fashion:true” are supported on modern browsers 
only.  Most changes to styling in the theme will update near real time with no browser 
refresh required.  However, theme changes that modify a component’s dimensions may require 
a manual browser refresh.

##Configuring Theme Inheritance
All Sencha theme packages are part of a larger hierarchy of themes and each theme package must extend a parent theme. 
The next step in creating your custom theme is to select which theme to extend. Ext JS ships with the following themes:

**"theme-base"** - This package is the base theme for all other themes and is the only theme that does not have a 
parent theme. It contains the bare minimum set of CSS rules that are absolutely required for Ext JS components and 
layouts to work correctly. The style rules in "theme-base" are not configurable in a derived theme. You should avoid 
overriding any of the style rules that are created by this theme.

**"theme-neutral"** - The neutral theme extends "theme-base", and contains the vast majority of configurable style 
rules. Most of the variables that are available for configuring the appearance of Ext JS components are defined in 
"theme-neutral". These are the variables that can be overridden by your custom theme.

**"theme-neptune"** - Modern borderless theme. Extends "theme-neutral".

**"theme-neptune-touch"** - Neptune-Based Touch Theme. Extends "theme-neptune".
This theme includes the "touch-sizing" package for use on tablets

**“theme-triton”** - Modern theme using font-icons.  Extends “theme-neptune”.

**"theme-crisp"** - Minimalistic Theme. Extends "theme-neptune".

**"theme-crisp-touch"** - Crisp-Based Touch Theme. Extends "theme-crisp".
This theme includes the "touch-sizing" package for use on tablets

**"theme-classic"** - The classic blue Ext JS theme. Extends "theme-neutral".

**"theme-gray"** - Gray theme. Extends "theme-classic".

**"theme-aria"** - Accessibility theme. Extends "theme-neptune".
This theme includes the "aria" package

This chart demonstrates how theme inheritance works in Ext JS.

<img src="images/theme_chart.png"/>

So, which theme should your custom theme extend? We recommend using either "theme-neptune", 
“theme-triton”, "theme-classic", or “theme-crisp” as the starting point for custom themes 
(or “theme-neptune-touch” / “theme-crisp-touch” when theming for tablets). The reason for 
this is that these themes contain all the code necessary for creating an attractive theme 
out of the box. The Neutral theme should be thought of as a very abstract theme, and should 
not typically need to be extended directly. Creating a custom theme by overriding "theme-neutral" 
requires hundreds of variable overrides and many hours of work and should only be done by 
very advanced theme developers. However, a custom theme derived from the Triton, Neptune, 
Crisp, or Classic theme can be up and running in minutes by simply changing a couple of 
variables. Additionally, you can override "theme-gray" or "theme-aria" if they provide a 
more desirable starting point for your custom theme.

In this tutorial we will create a custom theme that extends the Crisp theme. The first step 
is to configure your custom theme with the name of the theme it is extending. This is done 
by changing the `extend` property in “packages/local/my-classic-theme/package.json” from 
its default value as shown here:

	"extend": "theme-neptune"

to:

	"extend": "theme-crisp"

Your custom theme is now configured to use the Crisp theme as a base and your custom theme 
is identical to the default Crisp theme. In the following steps you’ll make your own changes 
to begin to differentiate your custom theme from Crisp.

##Configuring Global Theme Variables
Let’s start by modifying the base color from which many Ext JS components’ colors are 
derived.  Due to the use of `$base-color` through the default themes making a global change 
to `$base-color` will have an effect on most all components in the Ext JS library.  Create 
a new folder / file: “packages/local/my-classic-theme/sass/var/Component.scss”.  Add the 
following code to the Component.scss file:

	$base-color: #317040;

The value of “$base-color” must be a valid HTML color code; see the 
[HTML Color Codes](http://html-color-codes.info/) web page.

For the complete list of Ext JS global Fashion source variables see [[ext:Global_CSS]].

**Note:** When initially assigning a value to a user-defined variable you should include 
**“dynamic()”** around the variable value like a function call. This ensures that Sencha tooling
picks up the variable correctly.  When assigning values to an existing variable you can 
leave off the “dynamic()” wrapping.

##Using a Theme in an Application
To configure your test application to use your custom theme, find the following line in 
“theme-demo-app/app.json”

	"theme": "theme-triton",

and replace it with:

	"theme": "my-classic-theme",

As changes are made to your application and theme the “sencha app watch” routine will 
re-compile the theme and app as necessary.  Once “sencha app watch” finishes processing 
the change you can view the application in your browser at “localhost:1841/theme-demo-app/” 
(or when not using app watch: “localhost/my-workspace/theme-demo-app/”).  At this time you 
should see the green color we specified earlier as “$base-color” applied to the components 
on the screen.

##Configuring Component Variables
Each themeable Ext JS component has a list of variables that can be used to configure its 
appearance. Let’s change the font-family of Panel Headers in "my-classic-theme". Create a 
file named "my-classic-theme/sass/var/panel/Panel.scss" and add the following code:

	$panel-header-font-family: dynamic(Times New Roman);

View your application now and you should see that the panel headers use “Times New Roman” 
font.  You can find the complete list of variables for each component in the “CSS Variables” 
section of the component’s API doc. For example, see [[ext:Ext.panel.Panel]] and scroll 
down to the section titled “CSS Variables”

##Creating Custom Component UIs
Every component in the Ext JS framework has a user interface (`ui`) configuration, which 
defaults to `default`. This property can be configured on individual component instances 
to give them a different appearance from other instances of the same type. This config is 
used within the Neptune theme to create different types of [[ext:Ext.panel.Panel Panels]] 
and [[ext:Ext.button.Button Buttons]]. For example, panels with the ‘default’ UI have dark 
blue headers and panels with the ‘light’ UI have light blue headers. Buttons use UI’s to 
give toolbar buttons a different appearance from regular buttons.

The “theme-neutral” theme includes mixins for many different Ext JS components. You can 
call these mixins to generate new UIs for components. Available mixins for each component 
are listed in the API documentation. For example, see [[ext:Ext.panel.Panel]] and scroll 
down to the “CSS Mixins” section to see what parameters the Panel UI mixin accepts. Let’s 
use this mixin to create a custom Panel UI. Create a file named 
"my-classic-theme/sass/src/panel/Panel.scss" and add the following code to it:

	@include extjs-panel-ui(
	    $ui: 'highlight-framed',
	    $ui-header-background-color: red,
	    $ui-border-color: red,
	    $ui-header-border-color: red,
	    $ui-body-border-color: red,
	    $ui-border-width: 5px,
	    $ui-border-radius: 5px,
	    $ui-header-color: white
	);

This mixin call creates a new Panel UI named “highlight” which has a red header background, 
red bordering, 5px border, 5px border-radius, and white text. To use this UI, configure a 
Panel with “highlight” as its `ui` property (along with `frame: true`). Open 
"theme-demo-app/app/view/main/List.js" and replace its contents with the following:

	Ext.define('ThemeDemoApp.view.main.List', {
	    extend: 'Ext.grid.Panel',
	    xtype: 'mainlist',

	    ui: 'highlight',
	    frame: true,

	    requires: [
	        'ThemeDemoApp.store.Personnel'
	    ],

	    title: 'Personnel',

	    store: {
	        type: 'personnel'
	    },

	    columns: [
	        { text: 'Name',  dataIndex: 'name' },
	        { text: 'Email', dataIndex: 'email', flex: 1 },
	        { text: 'Phone', dataIndex: 'phone', flex: 1 }
	    ],

	    listeners: {
	        select: 'onItemSelected'
	    }
	});

View your application in a web browser and you should see the red “highlight” Grid.

While UI mixins are a handy way to configure multiple appearances for a component, they 
should not be overused. Each call to a UI mixin generates additional CSS rules. Gratuitous 
calls to UI mixins can produce an overly large CSS file.

##Slicing Images for CSS3 effects in IE
Many of the components within Ext JS have rounded corners and linear gradient 
backgrounds.  These effects are simple to accomplish in modern browsers using CSS3.  However, 
ExtJS supports IE8 and IE9; which either do not support these effects or do so in a way 
that makes combining the effects a challenge when generating cross-browser themes.

Sencha Cmd closes this gap by rendering each component requiring these effects in a headless 
browser and slicing images from the corners / gradients for use as background images in the 
component markup in IE8 / 9.  When adding custom UI’s you’ll need to include them in the 
slicing manifest used by Sencha Cmd so that the component decorated with the custom UI will 
be sliced for use in IE8 / 9.

To do this, we need to tell Sencha Cmd which components / UI’s need slicing.  In order to 
create slices for the rounded corners of the “highlight” panel UI that you created earlier 
in the guide, edit the file named “my-classic-theme/sass/example/custom.js” and add 
the following:

	Ext.theme.addManifest({
	    xtype: 'panel',
	    ui: 'highlight'
	});

**Note:** Multiple manifest entries may be added in the same “addManifest” call like:

	Ext.theme.addManifest({
	    xtype: 'panel',
	    ui: 'highlight'
	}, {
	    xtype: 'button',
	    ui: 'green'
	});

If you create an original component that requires slicing you’ll need to add any applicable 
UI configs to the slicing manifest as demonstrated above.  You will also need to add 
config entries for the custom component using the “Ext.theme.addShortcuts()” call in 
“custom.js”.    

The shortcut configs along with the UI’s passed to the manifest will be used in rendering 
the custom component for slicing.

For a more detailed description of how to use “Ext.theme.addShortcuts” and 
“Ext.theme.addManifest”,refer to the inline documentation descriptions for each method 
found in “my-classic-theme/sass/example/render.js”.  You can refer to examples of “addShortcuts” 
for the framework components within the “ext/classic/theme-base/sass/example/shortcuts.js” file.

##Theme JS Overrides
Sometimes a theme needs to change the appearance of some aspect of a component that is only 
configurable via JavaScript. This can easily be accomplished by adding a JavaScript 
override to your theme package. To demonstrate how this is done, let’s change the 
[[ext:Ext.panel.Panel#cfg-titleAlign titleAlign]] config of Panels in the custom theme. Create 
a new file named "my-classic-theme/overrides/panel/Panel.js" and add the following code:

	Ext.define('MyCustomTheme.panel.Panel', {
	    override: 'Ext.panel.Panel',
	    titleAlign: 'center'
	});

When you view the application in the browser you’ll notice that all Panel headers have 
centered titles.  Although any Ext JS component config can be overridden in this manner, best 
practice is to only use theme overrides to change those configs that directly affect the 
visual appearance of a component.

##Modifying Image Assets
All required image assets are inherited from the parent theme by default, but in some 
cases you may need to override an image. This can be easily done by placing the desired 
image in "my-classic-theme/resources/images/" and giving it the same name as the image it 
is intended to override. For example, let’s change the info icon of the MessageBox 
component. Save the following image as "my-classic-theme/resources/images/shared/icon-info.png".  This 
image asset will take precedence over the one used in the parent Crisp theme at 
“my-workspace/ext/classic/theme-crisp/resources/images/shared/icon-info.png”.

Now modify your test application to show a MessageBox that uses the custom icon. Add the 
following `tbar` config to the “highlight” Grid in your application’s 
"theme-demo-app/app/view/main/List.js" file:

    ...
    tbar: [{
        text: 'Show Message',
        handler: function() {
            Ext.Msg.show({
                title: 'Info',
                msg: 'Message Box with custom icon',
                buttons: Ext.MessageBox.OK,
                icon: Ext.MessageBox.INFO
            });
        }
    }]
    ...

Now, view the app in the browser. When you click the “Show Message” button you should see 
that the MessageBox contains a friendly face.

##Adding Custom Utility Fashion
If your theme requires functions or mixins that are not related to component styling 
(e.g. utilities), these should be placed in the theme’s "my-classic-theme/sass/etc" 
directory.  You can organize files in this directory however you like, but the only file 
that Sencha Cmd includes in the build is "my-classic-theme/sass/etc/all.scss".  Any other 
files must be imported (`@import`) by the "all.scss" file. For an example that follows 
this pattern see "ext/classic/theme-base/sass/etc/".

##Styling Your Application
Styling that is not shared between applications belongs in the application itself, not in 
the theme. Sencha Cmd provides an easy way to add application-level styling by following 
the same pattern as theme styling. The application acts as the final level in the theme 
hierarchy. Applications can change theme variables and may add their own custom variables 
and rules for styling the application’s views.

##Changing Theme Variables in Your Application
Let’s continue using the "theme-demo-app" application created above, and override the 
theme’s **$base-color** in the application. Open "theme-demo-app/sass/var/all.scss" and 
add the following code:

	$base-color: #724289;

View the application in a browser and you will see that the base color has changed to purple.

For each class in your application, Sencha Cmd checks for a corresponding “.scss” file in 
"sass/var/" for variables and "sass/src/" for rules.  Since the application has a class 
named “ThemeDemoApp.view.main.Main”, variables set for the Main view would be placed in a 
"theme-demo-app/sass/var/view/main/Main.scss" file and included in the build.

A common mistake is to attempt to style Ext JS classes in the “sass” directory of an 
application.  For example, an attempt to style “Ext.grid.Panel” by adding 
“theme-demo-app/sass/var/grid/Panel.scss” will fail. The namespace required for Sencha Cmd 
to check the application “sass” directory is the application name (“ThemeDemoApp”).  Sencha 
Cmd will not check the application “sass” directory for the “Ext” namespaced class.

**Note:** You can read more about how Sencha Cmd processes theming paths / namespaces in 
the “Namespace” section of the guide.

##Styling Your Application’s Views
CSS style rules for your application’s views should go in the app’s "sass/src/" directory 
in a scss file that has the same path and name as the view it is styling.  Let’s style the 
content of the **Users** tab in the ThemeDemoApp application. Since the main view is 
defined as `ThemeDemoApp.view.main.Main` in “theme-demo-app/app/view/main/Main.js”, the CSS 
rule that styles it goes in "theme-demo-app/sass/src/view/main/Main.scss":

	.content-panel-body h2 {
	    color: orange;
	}

Add the “content-panel-body” CSS class to the config of the **Users** panel in your 
application’s Main.js file:

    ...
    title: 'Users',
    iconCls: 'fa-user',
    html: '<h2>Content appropriate for the current navigation.</h2>',
    bodyCls: 'content-panel-body'
    ...

View your application and you’ll see that the `h2` element in the **Users** view is now 
orange.  CSS styles that apply to content across multiple components may also be placed 
in the “theme-demo-app/sass/var/all.scss” file.  While the ability to add arbitrary CSS 
styles offers maximum flexibility, any styling applied directly to application views 
extending Ext JS components should be styled using the Ext JS theming API whenever 
possible.  Using the theming API safeguards your styling against breaking markup changes 
in future versions of Ext JS.

##The Namespace
Sencha Cmd looks for “.scss” files within a theme / application’s “sass/var” and 
“sass/src” folders for each framework / application class it parses.  The file path on disc 
maps to the structure of the full class name.  For each class parsed, Sencha Cmd will use 
the configured `sass.namespace` to determine where to find associated “.scss” files.

For themes, the default `sass.namespace` is “Ext”.  So, any “Ext.*” class Sencha Cmd parses 
will result in a search within the theme’s “sass/var” and “sass/src” directories.  For example, 
when parsing “Ext.button.Button” Sencha Cmd will look for 
“my-classic-theme/sass/var/button/Button.scss” and “my-classic-theme/sass/src/button/Button.scss”.

For applications, the default `sass.namespace` is the application’s name (ThemeDemoApp in 
the case of our previous guide steps).  So, any “ThemeDemoApp.*” class Sencha Cmd parses 
will result in a search within the application’s “sass/var” and “sass/src” directories.  For 
example, when parsing “ThemeDemoApp.view.main.Main” Sencha Cmd will look for 
“theme-demo-app/sass/var/view/main/Main.scss” and “theme-demo-app/sass/src/view/main/Main.scss”.

In both cases, “sass/var” and “sass/src” are substituted for the `sass.namespace` value 
when mapping the class name to “.scss” file paths.  In the event you need to define styles 
for multiple namespaces with a theme or application you can set the `sass.namespace` value 
to empty.

For themes, you can set the `sass.namespace` value to “” in 
“my-classic-theme/local/package.json”.  In an application you’ll set the same empty-string 
value within “them-demo-app/app.json”.

	“sass”: {
	    “namespace”: “”
	}

Setting the namespace to “” allows you to define the namespace in the folder structure 
explicitly.  For example, the “Ext.button.Button” class variables would need to be set in 
“sass/var/Ext/button/Button.scss”.  Mixins for “ThemeDemoApp.view.main.Main” would need 
to be defined in “sass/src/ThemeDemoApp/view/main/Main.scss”.

##Organization of Generated Styles
When using themes as described above, the styling from your theme, your application, and 
from any required packages (see the 
[Sencha Cmd Packages guide](../../../../cmd/guides/cmd_packages/cmd_packages.html)) are all 
combined in an "app-all.scss" file that is then compiled by Sencha Cmd.  It is important 
to understand the structure of this file so that you know what you can use from your 
theme or required packages and when.

The structure of the "all.scss" file generated for your application is this:

	+---------------------------------------+
	| inclusion flags                       |
	+-----------+-----------+---------------+
	|           |           | base          |
	|           | theme     +---------------+
	|           |           | derived       |
	|           +-----------+---------------+
	|           |                           |
	|    etc    | packages (dep order)      |
	|           |                           |
	|           +---------------------------+
	|           |                           |
	|           | application               |
	|           |                           |
	+-----------+---------------------------+

Inside the “bands” for "sass/var" and "sass/src", the individual ".scss" files for a given 
theme, package, and the application are always ordered to match the JavaScript class 
hierarchy. For example, if the “base” theme had ".scss" files for [[ext:Ext.window.Window]] 
and [[ext:Ext.panel.Panel]] in its "sass/var" folder, the file for `Ext.panel.Panel` would 
be included before the file for `Ext.window.Window` since it extends `Ext.panel.Panel`.
The goals and rationale for this particular structure are as follows:

In the "sass/etc" space, utilities and the like from base themes should be available to 
derived themes.

Packages should be able to use facilities provided by the current theme.

Applications should be able to use their theme and any required packages.

In the "sass/var" space, the concerns are variable control and derived calculation.

Themes come next so that they pick up application variable values, but they come in “reverse” 
order from most derived theme to base. This allows the derived theme to set any variables 
it wants that have not already been set by the application or a more derived theme.

Package variables are introduced in their package dependency order. This allows package 
variables to derive the values from the current theme (most importantly, from the base-color).

Applications must be able to control all variables, so their vars come last.

In the "sass/src" section, the order is the same as for "sass/etc". This provides the proper 
cascade of rules so that derived theme rules can easily “win” over rules from their base theme(s).

The application cascades in last so that its rules always have the final authority.

###Inclusion Flags
The “inclusion flag” variables are a set of read-only variables defined to be true or false 
for each JavaScript class that may be included. The value of this variable is true if that 
class is being included in the application build. The variables are created dynamically by 
Sencha Cmd with a prefix of “$include-” followed by the full class name with its parts 
separated by “-” instead of “.” and all in lowercase.  For example, if the build uses 
[[ext:Ext.grid.Panel]], you can test for true within a custom mixin:

	@if $include-ext-grid-panel {
	    // styling contingent upon the presence of Ext.grid.Panel in the app
	}

**Note:** Through most of the guide we advocate for the use of “sencha app watch” to build 
your application incrementally as changes are made to both the application and the custom 
theme.  However, the “$include-” variables are all set to `true` in development (which is 
the environment “sencha app watch” operates within).  In order to test your theme’s use of 
“$include-” variable checks you’ll need to build your application for testing or production:

	sencha app build testing
	sencha app build

##Sharing a Theme Between Applications
It’s easy to share the theme you’ve just built with a second application. Simply navigate 
to the “my-workspace” directory and run the following command (note: if you’re following 
along using the steps above and have “sencha app watch” running you’ll first need to end 
it using “ctrl-c”):

	sencha -sdk ext generate app -classic AnotherApp another-app

This tells Sencha Cmd to generate an app in the “another-app” directory named “AnotherApp” 
and to use the same Ext JS SDK as the first app you created.

To ensure changes to the app and theme are picked up as you make them again change your 
working directory to the application directory and run “sencha app watch”:

	cd another-app
	sencha app watch

The next step is to tell the app to use the custom theme.  Edit “another-app/app.json” 
and replace the following line:

	/**
	 * The name of the theme for this application.
	 */
	"theme": "theme-triton",

with:

	/**
	 * The name of the theme for this application.
	 */
	"theme": "my-classic-theme",

When you view the “another-app/index.html” page in your browser you will now see a starter 
app that uses the same custom theme as “ThemeDemoApp”.

##Building the Theme
Building the theme creates a “build” directory in your theme package directory. Inside 
"my-classic-theme/build/resources" you will find a file named “my-classic-theme-all.css”. This 
file contains all the style rules for all Ext JS components for your theme. You can link 
directly to this file from your app however this is not recommended.  When Sencha Cmd 
builds an application for production it incorporates only the js and styles needed for 
that particular application.  The built theme’s "all" file contains all styles for every 
Ext JS component and should only be used outside of a Sencha Cmd generated app.

##Additional Notes

###‘default’ Component Images
Various components have images relating the the component’s “default” `ui` (Buttons, 
Menus, etc.).  When you create a custom ui for one of these components you’ll notice when 
the theme is compiled it warns that images for your theme were not found. 

	WARNING: @theme-background-image: Theme image not found:

While refreshing the theme / app, Sencha Cmd will be looking for images using the ui name 
in place of “default” in the image name.  For example, if you create a mixin ui with a 
name of “admin” for small Buttons, Sencha Cmd will warn that “admin-small-arrow.png” was 
not found.

The solution to this warning is to copy over any image assets with ‘default’ in the file 
name from the theme you’re extending into the custom theme’s “resources/images” 
directory.  You’ll then rename those files and replace “default” with the name of your 
custom ui.  So, in the case of the “admin” button ui in your custom theme extending Neptune 
you would copy the “default” images from the “ext/classic/theme-neptune/resources/images/button” 
folder and paste them into “packages/my-classic-theme/resources/images/button/”.  You’ll 
then rename all “default” instances to “admin”.  For instance:

	default-small-arrow.png

would be become:

	admin-small-arrow.png

**Note:** A bulk file name change utility may come in handy here.

###Ext.button.Button
Button ui images will need to be copied from the parent theme to the custom theme when 
creating a custom ui.  See the “‘default’ Component Images” section above for more detail.

Button scale can be configured as `small`, `medium`, or `large` with `small` being the 
default.  When creating custom UIs for buttons you’ll need to provide a button mixin for 
each scale used in your application.

**Note:** The “extjs-button-ui” mixin should be avoided in favor styling buttons using 
the -scale specific mixins.

	@include extjs-button-small-ui(
	    $ui: 'green',
	    $background-color: green
	);

	@include extjs-button-medium-ui(
	    $ui: 'green',
	    $background-color: green
	);

	@include extjs-button-large-ui(
	    $ui: 'green',
	    $background-color: green
	);

The same applies when using the “-toollbar” button mixins.  Each has a scale and should 
be included separately in the Button.scss file in order to support all button scales.  Additionally, 
when working with the “-toolbar” button mixins you will need to add “-toolbar” to the 
`ui` config of the button in your application.  Below is an example mixin for a small 
toolbar button mixin:

	@include extjs-button-toolbar-small-ui(
	    $ui: 'green',
	    $background-color: green
	);

which would decorate a button configured in a toolbar like:

	xtype: 'toolbar',
	items: [{
	    text: 'Toolbar Button',
	    ui: 'green-toolbar'
	}]

###Ext.panel.Panel
Panels may be configured with `frame: true` and are `frame: false` by default.  So, by 
default if you have a ui config of `ui: ‘highlight’` then the resulting `Panel.scss` 
would look like:

	@include extjs-panel-ui(
	    $ui: 'highlight',
	    $ui-header-background-color: red,
	    $ui-border-color: red,
	    $ui-header-border-color: red,
	    $ui-body-border-color: red,
	    $ui-border-width: 5px,
	    $ui-border-radius: 5px
	);

However, this will only apply styling to non-framed panels.  In order to style panels 
configured with `frame: true` and `ui: ‘highlight’` you will need to add “-framed” to the 
`$ui` name in the Panel.scss file.  Commonly both the framed and unframed ui versions will 
be represented in Panel.scss

	@include extjs-panel-ui(
		$ui: 'highlight',
		$ui-header-background-color: red,
		$ui-border-color: red,
		$ui-header-border-color: red,
		$ui-body-border-color: red,
		$ui-border-width: 5px,
		$ui-border-radius: 5px
	);
	
	@include extjs-panel-ui(
		$ui: 'highlight-framed',
		$ui-header-background-color: red,
		$ui-border-color: red,
		$ui-header-border-color: red,
		$ui-body-border-color: red,
		$ui-border-width: 5px,
		$ui-border-radius: 5px
	);

###Ext.menu.Menu
Menu ui images will need to be copied from the parent theme to the custom theme when 
creating a custom ui.  See the “‘default’ Component Images” section above for more detail.

###Ext.toolbar.Breadcrumb
Breadcrumb ui images will need to be copied from the parent theme to the custom theme 
when creating a custom ui.  See the “‘default’ Component Images” section above for more detail.

###Ext.tab.Tab
Tab ui images will need to be copied from the parent theme to the custom theme when 
creating a custom ui.  See the “‘default’ Component Images” section above for more detail.

When creating a tab ui be sure to include all applicable state vars you want to style 
including the “-active” tab states such as `$ui-color-active`, `$ui-background-color-active`, etc.

###Ext.tab.Bar
TabBar ui images will need to be copied from the parent theme to the custom theme when 
creating a custom ui.  See the “‘default’ Component Images” section above for more detail.

**Note:** When creating a tab bar UI with the extjs-tab-bar-ui mixin, you will need to 
create a corresponding tab-ui of the same name.

This will ensure that the tabs render properly in your theme. Not creating a matching 
tab theme may result in unpredictable tab rendering.

###Ext.toolbar.Toolbar
Toolbar ui images will need to be copied from the parent theme to the custom theme when 
creating a custom ui.  See the “‘default’ Component Images” section above for more detail.

##Upgrade from Ext 5 to Ext 6 Classic
While most of the updates to themeing occurred behind the scenes between Ext JS 5 and 6, 
there are a few changes to note when upgrading your theme.

Any variables defined in **{appRoot}/sass/etc/all.scss** should be moved to 
**{appRoot}/sass/var/all.scss** (or a .scss file @import’d by all.scss)

(_recommended_) Remove **!default** from the end of variable declarations
Initially declared user-defined variables should instead end with **dynamic()**.  This 
ensures that the variable can 1) be re-assigned downstream and 2) will be picked up by 
Sencha tooling applications.

(_recommended_) Relocate your custom theme folder from the root **“packages/”** folder in 
your application / workspace to **”packages/local/”**.
