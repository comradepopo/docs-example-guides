#What's New In Ext JS 6

## Introduction

With Ext JS 6, Sencha introduces a single framework for creating applications that run
across all types of devices, from phones to tablets to desktops. You will be able to produce 
an optimal user experience while writing less code. Combined with a compelling new theme, 
Ext JS 6 has everything you need to create amazing experiences on any device.

## Merging Ext JS and Sencha Touch

The process of merging Ext JS and Sencha Touch has come a long way. In Ext JS 5, Sencha
reconciled the core of its frameworks (Ext.data, Ext.app and much more) into the "core"
package. The visual layer remained as part of Ext JS proper in the "ext" package. The final
step of merging the Sencha Touch visual components required a home for these distinct
aspects of the framework. To differentiate the component families from each other in
Ext JS 6, we use the term "**toolkit**".

### Toolkits

A "toolkit" is a package that contains only the visual elements of the framework. These
include components like panels, buttons, grids and the rest. There are two toolkits in
Ext JS 6: **classic** and **modern**.

The visual elements of Ext JS are now contained in the **classic** toolkit of Ext JS 6,
while the visual elements of Sencha Touch are now contained in the **modern** toolkit.

Applications can simply choose their toolkit and add this to their `"app.json"`:

    "toolkit": "classic",  // or "modern"

### Common Core

Below the toolkits is the common "core" package. The core package provides a common API
for things like data (`Ext.data`) and application architecture (`Ext.app`). Based on the
common core, applications can share code for managing data as well as ViewModels or control
logic for communicating with the back-end.

### Coming From Sencha Touch

If you are upgrading from Sencha Touch, you'll immediately benefit from access to ViewModels
and ViewControllers when using the **modern** toolkit and the common core. You'll also be
using the multi-device event system introduced with Ext JS 5, so mouse events will seamlessly
translate to event listeners like `touchstart` without need to detect device capabilities.

### Universal Applications and Smart Phones

With Ext JS 6 and Sencha Cmd 6, however, you can create **Universal Applications** that
can use both toolkits. In this way you can create a single application that targets mobile
devices like smart phones or corporate desktops running IE8 or any device or browser in
between.

You can indicate which toolkits use which themes by omitting a toolkit key in your
Sencha Cmd generated `"app.json"` and, instead, include a modified `builds` block.

    "builds": {
        "classic": {
            "toolkit": "classic",
            "theme": "theme-triton"
        },

        "modern": {
            "toolkit": "modern",
            "theme": "theme-triton"
        }
    }

As you can see, we are designating "theme-triton" for both classic and modern toolkits,
but you could adjust the themes in any way you see fit.

If you have the above `builds` block in your `"app.json"` a "sencha app build" would build
both designated builds into unique folders.  You may also singularly build by targeting
the build key name.  For instance:

    sencha app build modern

Our Sencha Cmd generated starter app provides you with a working sandbox to use as a entry
point for your application. Or even better, check out the new Admin Dashboard application
template we've created (see below).

For more information about build profiles, please checkout the
[Developing for Multiple Screens and Environments](../application_architecture/developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments.html) 
guide

## Triton Theme

Central to this release is our latest theme named Triton. Triton is a flat, minimalistic theme
that puts the focus on your content and not on decorations like rounded corners or gradients.
The Triton theme is the first Ext JS theme to provide comprehensive support for "font icons".
Many of the icons used in Triton are from Font Awesome with some useful additions to complete
the ensemble. Using Triton, applications can easily control the size and color of these scalable,
vector images.

Support for font icons includes such items as panel tools, tree icons, form field triggers,
button arrows, checkboxes, radio buttons, grid action icons, grid column and filter menus,
slider thumbs, box and border splitters, toolbar overflow indicators â€¦ and more. Pretty
much all visual elements can use font icons.

### Touch Sizing

The Triton theme strikes a balance between desktop sizing and tablet sizing. For **classic**
toolkit, this one size approach is simpler to manage compared to the approach taken by Neptune
and Crisp which each provided a "touch-sized" derived theme.

For the **modern** toolkit, however, due to the use of CSS layouts, we are able to make size
more flexibly controlled. On smart phones, the `html` element automatically gains an `x-big`
class that will scale many items (such as buttons) to give them a larger target area.

![Modern Triton theme touch sizing](images/modern-big.png)

The KitchenSink buttons on the left are more suitable for desktop, while those on the right
would be more comfortable on a phone. You can change the default sizing by simply adding or
removing `x-big` from the `html` element when your application launches.

### Fashion

[Fashion](../../../cmd/6.x/fashion.html) is Sencha's new compiler for building themes based 
on `"*.scss"` files. Fashion is a Sass-like language with a few useful extensions to 
support tooling.  Fashion is implemented in JavaScript and runs within the browser and, 
when combined with PhantomJS, Sencha Cmd can use Fashion for theme builds as well as for 
`app watch`. 

This means no more Ruby system requirement! Because Fashion runs in the browser, we will 
not need to build the style rules twice (once for the slicer and again with the minimum 
required content). More importantly, we can do incremental rebuilds of the theme during 
`app watch`, which is a real benefit during development.

But there is an even more important benefit to `app watch` using Fashion - Live Updates! You
can open an application in a (modern) browser and the `.scss` files we be loaded instead 
of the generated CSS. Fashion can then react to file changes and update the CSS without
reloading the page.

## Promises Support

Ext JS 6 includes a standards-based implementation of promises that conforms to the
[Promises/A spec](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A) and
[tests suite](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests). A big "thanks" goes to the
[DeftJS team](http://deftjs.org/) for submitting their field tested implementation!

### Promises in Ext.Ajax

In future releases we will incorporate promises support in more areas of the framework,
but for Ext JS 6 we are starting with `Ext.Ajax.request()`. This method historically returned
an object to track the request in progress. That object is now an instance of a class
derived from `Ext.data.request.Base` which is `then-able` (in promises terminology). In
this way we preserve the current API of `Ext.Ajax.request()` as well as allow you to
write code like this:

    Ext.Ajax.request({
        url: 'some/url',
    }).then(function (response) {
        // use response
    });

### Creating Promises

Promises can be created in one of two forms: `new Ext.Promise()`, following the ECMAScript 6
standard `Promise` class, and `new Ext.Deferred()` which has several useful enhancements.

Using `Ext.Promise` is the same as using the new `Promise` constructor:

    function getAjax (url) {
        // The function passed to Ext.Promise() is called immediately to start
        // the asynchronous action.
        //
        return new Ext.Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            Ext.Ajax({
                url: url,
                success: function (response) {
                    // Use the provided "resolve" method to deliver the result.
                    //
                    resolve(response);
                },
                failure: function (response) {
                    // Use the provided "reject" method to deliver the error
                    //
                    reject(response);
                }
            });
        });
    }

Of course, now that `Ext.Ajax.request()` supports promises there is no need to do this,
but it illustrates how an asynchronous action can be converted to use `Ext.Promise`.

On browsers that natively support `Promise`, the `Ext.Promise` reference will be assigned
to `Promise` and will therefore only include the native features of a promise.

The equivalent using `new Ext.Deferred()` method looks like this:

    function getAjax (url) {
        var deferred = new Ext.Deferred();
        
        Ext.Ajax({
            url: url,
            success: function (response) {
                // Use the provided "resolve" method to deliver the result.
                //
                deferred.resolve(response);
            },
            failure: function (response) {
                // Use the provided "reject" method to deliver the error
                //
                deferred.reject(response);
            }
        });
        
        return deferred.promise;
    }

The key difference between `Ext.Promise` and `Ext.Deferred` is that the creator has direct
access to the "behind-the-scenes" object managing the user's promise, that is the `Ext.Deferred`
instance. Using this object, the provider of the asynchronous operation can use additional
features (such as progress updates) that go beyond the current promises standard. In addition,
the promise instance returned by `Ext.Deferred` has additional methods that go along with
the extra features provided by `Ext.Deferred`.

## Classic Grid

### Spreadsheet

The new spreadsheet model introduced in Ext JS 5.1 now has a couple of cool new features. The
selection can be made **extensible** (by setting `extensible:true`). This adds the
"drag-corner" or a small block on the bottom-right corner of the selection. This allows the
current selection to be extended either vertically or horizontally.

![image alt text](images/selection.png)

This will be often combined with a plugin that will use the current selection to replicate
values into the expanded area (again like a spreadsheet).

### Actionable Mode (Accessibility)

Grids also support ARIA's "actionable mode" - an extension of our traditional cell edit
mode. This allows all kinds of cell content to be focused and activated using only the
keyboard. This is a huge step for accessibility but also makes for happy keyboard users
since they can interact with anything in the grid without their hands leaving the keyboard.

Enter actionable mode using the F2 key. ENTER also starts cell editing which
is now an example of actionable mode.

### Locking grids

Navigation within a locking grid now navigates across the locking boundary. This is in both
"navigable mode" (the default cell navigation mode) and "actionable mode" when cell contents
are accessible and visited using the TAB key.

## Modern Grid

The grid component in the **modern** toolkit has many new exciting developments as well. In
the **modern** toolkit, much of the grid feature set is actually part of `Ext.dataview.List`
(its base class). The grid is a component list that uses a `Ext.grid.Row` for each item in
its store.

Unlike the Sencha Touch Grid, however, in Ext JS 6, the Row component is now a lightweight
container for cell widgets. In fact, cells are instances of classes in the `Ext.grid.cell`
namespace. These widgets come together with ViewModels making it easy to manage cells and
their configs using data binding, like so:

    {
        xtype: 'grid',
        
        // Configure the Row (the List item):
        //
        itemConfig: {
            // viewModel: true,  // a default viewmodel
            // or:
            //
            viewModel: {
                type: 'mygrid-row'  // enable formulas etc.
            }
        },

        columns: [{
            text: 'Age',
            // ...
            cell: {
                bind: {
                    cls: '{record.cls}'
                }
            }
        }]
    }

The Row component ensures that the `record` property is published to its ViewModel (if it
is configured with one). All Cells in the row are implicitly connected to the Row's ViewModel
which of course inherits any higher-level ViewModels via the Grid.

The "infinite" list (buffered renderer) will only create a handful of Row components and
will recycle them by reconfiguring their `record` to that of the needed record. This will
naturally update the bound configs on child Cells.

Finally, using `widgetcell` (`Ext.grid.cell.Widget`) we can put components in a grid cell.
And, of course, they can leverage data binding as well.

    {
        xtype: 'grid',
        //...

        columns: [{
            text: 'Verify',
            // ...

            cell: {
                xtype: 'widgetcell',

                widget: {
                    xtype: 'button',
                    ui: 'action',
                    bind: 'Verify {record.firstName}',
                    handler: 'onVerifyUser'  // route to ViewController
                }
            }
        }]
    }

To see the **modern** grid in action, check out the KitchenSink.

## The Treelist Widget

The Admin Dashboard application template showcases not only our new Triton theme but also
the newest member of the growing Widget family: `treelist`. Being a Widget, `treelist` is
available in both the **modern** and the **classic** toolkits.

![Admin Dashboard app template](images/app-template.png)

Beyond use in a navigation area, the `treelist` can be used similarly to a `tree` component. There
are a few key differences:

  - Treelist provides a ui mixin (it generated the navigation view above).
  - Treelist has a "micro" mode where only top-level node icons are visible. Children are
    displayed in a floating element (as seen above).
  - Treelist renders all nodes in its `TreeStore` (it does not support buffered rendering).
    Nodes can, of course, be fetched asynchronously.
  - Treelist nodes are themselves rendered as Widgets.
  - Treelist supports selection and hover "indicator" (the vertical blue strip on the selected node).
  - Treelist only supports single-selection.
  - Treelist does not support additional columns.
  - Treelist does not support grid plugins.

This makes a `treelist` suitable for trees that don't contain too many nodes. For large datasets,
the standard `tree` component should still be preferred.

The KitchenSink example allows you to play with some of the configs on the `treelist` on-the-fly.

![Treelist widget](images/treelist.png)

As you can see here, the `ui` config can be set dynamically and the tree will update
accordingly.

In the **modern** KitchenSink sink example, the `treelist` looks almost identical:

![Treelist in modern toolkit](images/modern-treelist.png)

## Responsive Column Layout

The Admin Dashboard also leverages our newest layout for the **classic** toolkit: `responsivecolumn`.
A common design goal for applications is to present content in a grid-like form with a
variable number of columns based on the available space. With IE8's lack of CSS `@media`
support, this goal can be a challenge to achieve. This is where `responsivecolumn` comes in.

You create a container using `responsivecolumn` and describe the layout states you want to
handle.

    {
        xtype: 'container',
        layout: {
            type: 'responsivecolumn',
            states: {
                small: 800,
                large: 0
            }
        },
        items: [{
            xtype: 'panel',
            responsiveCls: 'large-50 small-100'
        },{
            xtype: 'panel',
            responsiveCls: 'large-50 small-100'
        }]
    }

We then add CSS rules to match these classes:

    .large-100 {
        @include responsivecolumn-item(100%);
    }

    .large-50 {
        @include responsivecolumn-item(50%);
    }
    
    .x-responsivecolumn-small {
        > .small-100 {
            @include responsivecolumn-item(100%);
        }
    }

The result is that each panel takes up 50% of the width when the viewport is "large" (more
than 800px) and 100% of the width when the viewport is "small" (less than 800px).

The `responsivecolumn` layout will add a CSS class to the container based on which state
matches the current viewport size. These dynamically maintained classes allow all browsers to
apply appropriate styling without requiring `@media`. The `responsivecolumn` layout is found
in the "ux" package.

## Theming In The Modern Toolkit

With the introduction of Triton in the **modern** toolkit we have given a lot of attention
to theme creation. We've organized themes into packages to enable theme derivation. In fact
the Triton theme extends the Neptune theme which is also available now in the **modern**
toolkit. We've also revisited the concept of the "ui" config and optimized how it is handled.
Since modern browsers don't require complex solutions like framing, ui mixins can be made
significantly simpler and therefore more flexible and efficient.

We started with buttons and created the new `button-ui` mixin. This mixin takes many optional
arguments (currently 45!) that you can use to tune almost every visual aspect of the `Ext.Button`
component. The key difference from the **classic** mixin is that this mixin will only
generate the few *additional* style rules needed to achieve the given adjustments.

To see how this works, consider this use of `button-ui`:

    {
        xtype: 'button',
        ui: 'rounded'
    }
    
    //...
    
    @include button-ui(
        $ui: 'rounded',
        $border-radius: 8px,
        $border-radius-big: 12px  // size when x-big is present
    );

The entire generated CSS would look something like this:

    .x-button-rounded {
        border-radius: 8px;
    }
    .x-big .x-button-round {
        border-radius: 12px;
    }

This implies that the `button` element will get most of its styling from the `x-button` CSS
class and will gain the above styles *as well*. You can even use multiple names in the `ui`
config to compose multiple adjustments:

    {
        xtype: 'button',
        ui: 'rounded red'
    }
    
    //...
    
    @include button-ui(
        $ui: 'red',
        $background-color: red
    );

The tiny additional CSS needed to make buttons red would then apply via `x-button-red` in
addition to the border radius from `x-button-rounded`.

We are delighted with what we've seen from this approach and are confident it will help
applications achieve their aesthetic goals while at the same time future proof their code
by keeping the details behind the mixin API. Look for more ui mixins for other components
following this pattern in future releases.

## Charts

### Pie 3D

The biggest new features in the charts package are the improvements to the 3D pie series ('pie3d').
It now supports labels, legend, highlighting, tooltips, bevels and has improved shading with
configurable level of 3D effect.

![image alt text](images/3dchart.png)

The various sliders in the new Charts KitchenSink example allow you play with each of those
and see how they alter the appearance of the chart.

### Plugins

The new **itemedit** plugin allows users to drag 'bar' series items and markers of the
'scatter' series to edit the underlying data.

![image alt text](images/scatter_itemedit.png)

![image alt text](images/bar_itemedit.png)

### Events

Declarative renderers (named methods implemented by a ViewController) are now supported
for axis labels as well as series labels, items and tooltips.

## Ext JS Premium

With Ext JS Premium there are two additional code packages: exporter and pivot. These packages
provide Excel data export and the Pivot Grid to help users display and analyze their data.

### Pivot Grid

The pivot grid component is now provided in the `pivot` package and lives in the `Ext.pivot`
namespace. The main enhancements to the pivot grid are seen in the Configurator plugin.

#### Enhanced Configurator

![image alt text](images/configurator.png)

The interface to the configurator has been revamped and can now be docked on any side,
including on the right (or left) as shown above. You can also configure whether or not 
the configurator panel is collapsible.

#### Exporter Plugin

The `pivotexporter` plugin replaces the old Excel export plugin. This one uses a more generic
approach and allows you to export the pivot grid data to any Exporter available in the class system.

The `pivot` package requires the `exporter` package so you'll need both in your "packages"
folder.

Example:

    {
        xtype: 'pivotgrid',
        plugins: [{
            ptype: 'pivotexporter'
        }]
    }
     
    // Somewhere on a button you may have something like this
    //
    grid.saveDocumentAs({
        type: 'excel', // exporter alias
        title: 'Excel export',
        
        onlyExpandedNodes: false,
        showSummary: true,
        
        fileName: 'export.xml'
    });
     
    // saveDocumentAs will try to save the file in the browser. If your browser is not
    // supported then do this
    //
    var xml = grid.getDocumentData({
         type: 'excel', // exporter alias
         title: 'Excel export',
         
         onlyExpandedNodes: false,
         showSummary: true
    });
    
    // and probably send the xml content to the server

#### Label filter operators

There are two new Label filter operators available: `in` and `not in`.

    leftAxis: [{
        header: 'Country',
        dataIndex: 'country',
        
        filter: {
            type: 'label',
            operator: 'in',
            value: [ 'USA', 'Canada', 'Australia' ]
        }
    }]

### Exporter

The exporter package contains classes you can use to create Excel documents as well as a
grid plugin that you can add to your grid to add Excel export capability.

#### Exporter plugin

This plugin enables grid data to be exported to Excel. It can either save the file if the
browser supports it or generate the content for further processing. Grid columns that should
not be exported need to have their `ignoreExport` config set.

This plugin is part of the `exporter` package which means that it should be added to the app
packages folder and required in `app.json`.

Example:

    {
        xtype: 'grid',
        plugins: [{
            ptype: 'gridexporter'
        }]
    }
     
    // Somewhere on a button you may have something like this
    //
    grid.saveDocumentAs({
        type: 'excel', // exporter alias
        title: 'Excel export',
        
        fileName: 'export.xml'
    });
     
    // saveDocumentAs will try to save the file in the browser. If your browser
    // is not supported then do this
    //
    var xml = grid.getDocumentData({
        type: 'excel', // exporter alias
        title: 'Excel export'
    });

    // and probably send the xml content to the server

#### Content

![image alt text](images/exporter_structure.png)

#### Generate Excel XML documents

The `exporter` package contains classes that allows you to generate Excel XML documents with
any data that you need. 

Here is a basic example of how to achieve this:

    var workbook = Ext.create('Ext.exporter.file.excel.Workbook', {
            title: 'My document',
            author: 'John Doe'
        });

    var table = workbook.addWorksheet({
            name: 'Sheet 1'
        }).addTable();
    
    // Add formatting to the first two columns of the spreadsheet
    //
    table.addColumn({
        width:  120,
        styleId: workbook.addStyle({
            format: 'Long Time'
        }).getId()
    });
    
    // ... etc ...
    
    // Add a formula on the 4th row which sums up the previous 2 rows
    table.addRow().addCell({
        index: 2,
        formula: '=SUM(R[-2]C:R[-1]C)'
    });
    
    // Save the document in the browser
    //
    Ext.exporter.File.saveAs(workbook.render(), 'document.xml', 'UTF-8'); 
    
The above document will look something like this:

![image alt text](images/whatsnew_image_6.png)

#### Custom Exporters

The Excel Exporter comes with the `exporter` package and it is used by both grid and pivot
grid plugins to generate Excel documents. You can write your own custom exporter classes by
extending from `Ext.exporter.Base` and direct the plugins to use your custom format.

    Ext.define('My.custom.Exporter', {
        extend: 'Ext.exporter.Base',
        alias: 'exporter.custom',
        ...
    });

    grid.saveDocumentAs({
        type: 'custom',
        title: 'Custom export',
        
        fileName: 'custom-format.xml'
    });

### More To Come

In future releases we will add additional packages to Ext JS Premium as well as continue to
enhance the Ext JS foundations.

## Screen Reader Support (Accessibility)

We have integrated ARIA functionality directly into the component life-cycle. This means
you won't need a special "aria" package to get correct ARIA behavior. Applications will
now support screen readers (like JAWS) without additional effort.

## Microloader

Sencha Cmd 6 now includes localStorage caching of assets. This is similar to Sencha Touch's
production microloader but with some important improvements.

* Caching can be disabled in app.json
* Only the current version of an app will be kept in local storage
* Only microloader content will ever be erased by the microloader
